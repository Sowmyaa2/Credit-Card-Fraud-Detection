# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Overview
This project utilizes Autoencoders implemented in Keras for detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Autoencoders are employed to learn the normal patterns in non-fraudulent transactions, enabling the identification of anomalies based on reconstruction errors.

Features
- Autoencoder model trained on credit card transaction data
- Keras implementation for easy usage and customization
- Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance

Results
Include any relevant results or performance metrics achieved by the model.
